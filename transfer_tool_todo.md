# File Transfer Tool Development TODO

## Project Overview

A TUI-based file transfer tool for managing large-scale data transfers (multi-GB to TB) between remote systems. Built with Rust and ratatui, providing real-time progress monitoring, transfer management, and status updates.

## Getting Started - Recommended Approach

### Development Timeline
1. **Week 1-2**: Basic infrastructure (SSH connections, config management)
2. **Week 3-4**: File discovery and rsync integration  
3. **Week 5-6**: Basic TUI with file browsers
4. **Week 7-8**: Transfer engine with progress tracking
5. **Week 9+**: Polish, error handling, advanced features

### Key Dependencies
```toml
[dependencies]
tokio = { version = "1.0", features = ["full"] }
ratatui = "0.26"
crossterm = "0.27"
clap = { version = "4.0", features = ["derive"] }
serde = { version = "1.0", features = ["derive"] }

tracing-subscriber = "0.3"
```

### Critical Path (MVP Focus)
1. Basic project setup and dependencies
